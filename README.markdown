# Ruby Quiz but with Javascript ;)

Each month, we'll add a new quiz for you to solve.

Then, at the [Vienna.js meetup at the end of each month](http://www.meetup.com/viennajs/ "Vienna.js") we'll talk about our solutions.

## How to submit your solution

* Fork this repository
* Add your solution to the appropriate month in a subfolder with your name (We recommend using your GitHub username, but anything is alright as long as it doesn't collide with anybody else)
* Push your solution to your fork on GitHub
* Send us a pull request
